# Reflection

## What advice would I give myself
- Figure out how some codes can affect other codes even if it's unintended
- Have a cohesive color theme instead of just throwing color together
- Get a clear understanding of the code i need to write instead of making it up as i go

## Was everything in the Needed list completed?
- yes

## Hardest part
- bug-testing
- screenstate and reseting the game
- getting an animated bg which i ended up abandoning

## Any problem I couldn't solve
- at the end the button i add to change screenstate into game start wouldn't let me change it even though the code to start the music within the same button work
